  <h3>Cancellation &amp; No-Show Policy</h3>
  <p>Although unanticipated conflicts sometimes arise, it is the expectation that you will contact me to cancel scheduled appointments. 24-hour notice is required for cancellations. If you do not cancel and then do not come to an appointment, a &#36;45 Cancellation Fee will be charged to your debit/credit card on file. Cancellation due to emergency, sudden illness, or severe weather may be considered exceptions. More than 3 missed appointments in one month may result in losing your reserved time.</p>

  <h3>Phone &amp; Email Communication</h3>
  <p>Phone calls and/or emails to or from you, or on your behalf, that are less than 15 minutes will be considered a free consultation within reason. Phone calls and/or emails that are 15 minutes or longer are subject to a &#36;45 consultation charge. These fees will be charged directly to your debit/card on file.</p>
