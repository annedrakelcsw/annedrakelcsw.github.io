- question: What is play therapy?
  answer: Play can be incredibly powerful. It can teach children how to express thoughts and feelings, learn to solve problems, and modify their behavior. Through play therapy, I use games, art, sandtrays, and other toys to create a safe place for children to learn new skills, manage their emotions, and develop resiliency.

- question: How should I prepare my child for the first appointment?
  answer: Many parents are unsure of what to say to their child prior to the first appointment. For many children, knowing what to expect can lessen the anxiety when the appointment arrives. Although the details you share will depend on the age of the child, it is important to tell them who they will be seeing and why. It is important for them to know that this is a safe place where I can help them solve the problem of (feeling nervous when they go to bed, feeling angry at their sister, their family is changing, etc.) Explain that they may play games or play with toys that will help them feel better. Whatever the challenge, it is important to use language that your child will understand.

- question: What can I expect at my first appointment?
  answer: The first appointment is an assessment and the beginning of the therapeutic relationship. This will be an opportunity for me to get know you and your child and begin to build a trusting relationship, which is the foundation for successful healing. I will meet with your child alone for the first part of the session. For the remaining fifteen to twenty minutes, you (the parents) will join us. This time will be used to discuss the therapeutic process and what to expect as sessions continue.

- question: Do you only use play therapy?
  answer: No, I use a variety of approaches based on what works best for the child/client. Although I do believe that play therapy is one of the most successful methods to use with children, and this is my primary approach, I also include more directive activities to address specific concerns and issues.
