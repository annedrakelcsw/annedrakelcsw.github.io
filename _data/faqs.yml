- question: How should I prepare my child for the first appointment?
  answer: Many parents are unsure of what to say to their child prior to the first appointment. For many children, knowing what to expect can lessen the anxiety when the appointment arrives. Although the details you share will depend on the age of the child, it is important to tell them who they will be seeing and why. It is important for them to know that this is a safe place where I can help them solve the problem of (feeling nervous when they go to bed, feeling angry at their sister, their family is changing, etc.) Explain that they may play games or play with toys that will help them feel better. Whatever the challenge, it is important to use language that your child will understand.

- question: What can I expect at my first appointment?
  answer: The first appointment is an assessment and the beginning of the therapeutic relationship. This will be an opportunity for me to get know you and your child and begin to build a trusting relationship, which is the foundation for successful healing. I will meet with your child alone for the first part of the session. For the remaining fifteen to twenty minutes, you (the parents) will join us. This time will be used to discuss the therapeutic process and what to expect as sessions continue.

- question: What is play therapy?
  answer: Play can be incredibly powerful. It can teach children how to express thoughts and feelings, learn to solve problems, and modify their behavior. Through play therapy, I use games, art, sandtrays, and other toys to create a safe place for children to learn new skills, manage their emotions, and develop resiliency. For information on play therapy, please visit the <a href="http://www.a4pt.org/page/WhyPlayTherapy" target="_blank">Association of Play Therapy</a> website.

- question: Do you only use play therapy?
  answer: No, I use a variety of approaches based on what works best for the child/client. Although I do believe that play therapy is one of the most successful methods to use with children, and this is my primary approach, I also include more directive activities to address specific concerns and issues.

- question: Do you only see children?
  answer: As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, I am trained to work with all ages of clients and address a variety of needs. I currently work with clients from ages 4 through adulthood.

- question: Do you accept insurance?
  answer: I am an approved provider for Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO of Illinois. I am considered out-of-network for all other providers. I can provide you with a receipt, known as a superbill, that you can submit to your provider for partial reimbursement.

- question: Do you have to give my child a diagnosis?
  answer: Insurance providers require a diagnosis in order for services to be reimbursed. If you choose to use insurance, I must provide a diagnosis. For this reason, many parents will choose to pay out of pocket rather than use insurance. There are some insurance plans that will not cover certain diagnoses, such as those pertaining to adjustment or relationship issues. Insurance companies may also limit the number of sessions a client can use based on of their diagnosis or pay for only certain types of treatment, influencing the overall treatment process without a client's best interest in mind.

- question: When and how do I pay you for the session?
  answer: Payment is due at the time of the session. I accept cash, check, and credit cards, including Health Savings Account (HSA) cards. Payment made by credit card will be assessed a 2% service fee to cover the cost of transactions. I am not able to accept payment via apps, such as Zelle or Venmo, at this time. Please see the <a href="payments.html">Payments Policy</a> page for specific information regarding payments.

- question: What are your hours?
  answer: I work Sunday through Thursday by appointment. Weekend and after-school hours are the most popular and can be harder to get. If you live near the office and have some flexibility, please consider a before-school appointment for more availability.
